## Activity Description

### Objective
Design and develop an interactive image gallery, in addition to being built dynamically with JavaScript, users should be able to reveal additional information (larger version of the image, details about the image, etc.) by interacting with the gallery and images.

### Requirements
- [x] The image gallery should utilize modern layout techniques using Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- [x] A minimum of 12 images should be dynamically added to the gallery using JavaScript.
- [x] Clicking on an image should reveal an HD version of the image and a caption describing the image.
- [x] Clicking on the HD version of the image should hide the HD version and caption.
- [x] Ensure you have permission to use any external resources.
- [x] Make sure that all images are optimized, and that they respond to the layout.
- [x] Event Delegation must be used in the project.
- [x] You may not use inline events. All DOM events must be handled using Event Listeners
